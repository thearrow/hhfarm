###Being a WWOOFer

WWOOFers welcome! We accept, encourage and enjoy WWOOFers from all regions and backgrounds to join us in our Community Supported Agriculture Project and be a part of the unique culture of wild west Montana. WWOOFing Season typically begins in early June and Continues until early September, though off-season applicants may also be considered. 

**Requirements of WWOOFer:** Knowledge and experience in farming and gardening is not required, though of course preferred. A certain amount of independence is desirable and WWOOFers are generally required to work on projects and do farm duties without much supervision (however instruction will be provided). In general, we'd like to make you feel like one of the family and introduce you to our way of life. An honest and friendly demeanor is appreciated.

**Work Schedule:** 5 hours per day and 25 hours per week (Monday through Friday). Working times are generally very flexible and can meet your schedule and/or needs.

**Accommodation/Housing:** We offer a variety of accommodation setups ranging from the rustic to the comfy-cozy
