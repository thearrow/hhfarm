### Frequently Asked Questions

<br/>
**What is a CSA?**

'CSA' stands for 'Community Supported Agriculture.' In essence, it is a growingly common system of agriculture whereby members pay or trade work for shares of the fruits and vegetables produced by a farmer in their local community.

The farmer offers a certain number of shares to the local community; usually limited by the amount of produce the farmer is able to grow. Interested members of the community purchase or trade work time for these shares, and in return receive a box of fresh, locally grown vegetables, fruits and flowers, once a week, throughout the growing season.

**Why choose to be a member of Harvest House Farm (CSA)?**

(1) CSA's support their local community. By buying locally produced fresh fruit and veggies you are keeping money circulating in your local economies. Instead of giving your money to huge agribusiness, you are giving money to your friends and neighbors. Local economies become more diverse, robust and stable, and instead of huge plowed acreages, beautiful small garden plots proliferate.

Further, Harvest House Farm has programs to trade work time on the farm, for shares in its total produce. Relationships are forged in garden tasks, acquaintances made, and piece by piece, communities can be sewn together; the CSA becomes a community center for neighbors and friends. At Harvest House Farms, we now have many working members trading their time for veggies, often bringing their children, pets and loved ones along to enjoy a day on the farm--and we encourage a relaxed working atmosphere so that work time can also be family get-together time

Finally, Harvest House Farms serves to many as an outdoor education center. Teaching members and curios others about the age old joys and tribulations of farming and generally working with the land to support one's self.
